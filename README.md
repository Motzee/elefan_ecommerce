# elefan_ecommerce
A training project for an ecommerce website with Symfony framework


##Presentation

*(fictive)Silent partner : [L'éléfàn](https://lelefan.org "website of the association L'éléfàn"), an association from Grenoble
*target users : clients from the association and people from Grenoble
*problem : currently, clients have to move to the association's building to know which products they can order, and when they come back a week later they don't know if there was enough stock for them to have what they have ordered.
*solution :  website will help them to show products available this month, and to pre-order. L'éléfàn will have an easier way to manage clients'orders and stocks.
nb : it's not important to have a payment system because there is no delivery at home (clients pay when they go to the store to take their order. As there is a market in the store, they can also do shopping before paying their order).
*Most important functionnality : order products placed in the basket
*"I'm special !" : L'éléfàn is a local association, based on a participative project, with local growers and producers for quality and tasty products, respecting environnment and a honest price. They ask for transparency and human contact, website need to reflect all these things.
*Core-user journey : each rectangle is a vue, each arrow is an action for the user, in purple utility of each vue, and in green clues to guide navigation.
